# 📖 Capstone-React-Redux <a name="about-project"></a>

**Capstone-React-Redux** is  a project which is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics data (numeric values) from an API chosen using React and Redux.

I selected a CryptoCurrency API that provides numeric data about all popular cryptocurrencies. The webapp had two pages:

  **-Home page :**

1. When the page loads, the web app shows the list of categories that could be filtered out by some parameter, for example by the category name.
2. Along with the category name, it will display some numeric values per category that come from the API.
3. When the user clicks (or taps) on a category item, the application navigates to the details page.

**-Details page**

1. In the details page, the web app retrieves data from the API to show detailed data in the category.
2. When the user clicks on the "Back" button (<), the user navigates to the home page.
