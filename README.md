# 📖 Capstone-React-Redux <a name="about-project"></a>

**Capstone-React-Redux** is  a project which is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics data (numeric values) from an API chosen using React and Redux.

I selected a CryptoCurrency API that provides numeric data about all popular cryptocurrencies. The webapp had two pages:
  - One page with a list of crptocurrencies. This page is the homepage.
  - One page for each Cryptocurrency's details.
